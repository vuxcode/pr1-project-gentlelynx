> Make a list of the things that don't work as expected. Keep a list of things that you have fixed and try to document how you solved them.

1. *The length of the repeating part of the row messes with the total length of the row. Temporarily "solved" it with Math.floor(), but this needs a proper address when there is time*
2. *The stitches in the output pattern stop aligning after column 10*
